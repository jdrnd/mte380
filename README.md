## MTE 380 Code

#### Getting Started
We're using PlatformIO to manage our code and board dependancies. Here's the getting started guide: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html#installation

Make sure you install for VSCode instead of Atom on *Windows*. The PlatformIO ide provides the build, flash, and serial monitor in the bottom toolbar. The board settings are in the `platformio.ini` file.

#### General git workflow
Start a new branch, commit to that branch, rebase onto master and open a pull request, get it approved, rebase again and merge the PR.


#### Utilities
SerialPlot: to plot recieved sensor readings in real time: https://hackaday.io/project/5334-serialplot-realtime-plotting-software
